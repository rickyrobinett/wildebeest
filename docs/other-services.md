## Additional Cloudflare services

Since Wildebeest is a Cloudflare app running on Pages, you can seamlessly enable additional Cloudflare services to protect or improve your server.

### Protection

Once Wildebeest is up and running, you can protect it from bad traffic and malicious actors. Cloudflare offers you [DDoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ddos/), [WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/waf/), and [Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/bot-management/) protection out of the box at a click's distance.

### Analytics

Likewise, you'll get instant network and content delivery optimizations from our products and [analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/analytics/) on how your Wildebeest instance is performing and being used.

### Email Routing

If you want to receive Email at your @social.example domain, you can enable [Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/get-started/enable-email-routing/) for free and take advantage of sophisticated Email forwarding and protection features. Simply log in to your account, select the Wildebeest zone and then click on Email to enable.
